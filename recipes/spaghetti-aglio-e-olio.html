    <h2> Description </h2>
    <div>
        No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly
        toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
        flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti </li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li> ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li> 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a
                pasta bowl. </li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to
                slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook
                and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and
                sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </li>
            <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
