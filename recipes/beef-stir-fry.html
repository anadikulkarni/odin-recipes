    <h2> Description </h2>
    <div>
        Need to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients? Look no further than a
        classic beef stir-fry. This beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires
        ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them!

        This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the
        boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.

        <h3>How to Cook Beef Stir-Fry </h3>
        <p>
            If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you
            cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out.
            They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil.

            If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook
            the meat and veggies in separate batches.

            When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should
            sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut
            oil, for the best stir-fry results.

        <h3> How to Make Beef Stir-Fry </h3>

        <p>
            The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into
            smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.

            After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large
            frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides
            together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.

            Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and
            rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry
            sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.

        <h3>What Cut of Beef Is Best For Beef Stir-Fry?</h3>
        <p>
            Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak,
            skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck.

            Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to
            remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying.
